# hng-sha256-chia
This script helps one to generate a hash SHA256 from json file that has been parsed from a csv file.

## usage
```
git clone https://github.com/AmbroseOtundo/hng-sha256-chia
```
```
cd hng-sha256-chia
```
Load a sample csv file to the root directory ~ (hng-sha256-chia) that matches the json schema to avoid conflicts
####
In the script we have two folders -- files and json. The files stores the output_filename.csv and the json folder stores individual <br>
generated json files.

```
run python hashing_file.py
```
